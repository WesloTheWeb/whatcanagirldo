A project I did for Ashdon Farms in 2018, affiliated with the Girl Scouts. It was a great project that incorporated a lot into HTML CSS skills that I am proud of.

This project taught me how to write better code, simplify things and think creatively. Also it was my first time animating a "swing" with CSS. This project was completed August 17th, 2018
